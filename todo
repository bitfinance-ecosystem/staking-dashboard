# To-do
A BitFinance Ecosystem & Blockchain Developments todo list app built in HTML, Node.js, CSS and JavaScript.


## Functionalities

- To Develop BitFinance sharding protocol with a trustless Ethereum bridge. 
 
- BitFinance use Ethereum tooling such as Solidity and Ether.js. Users use Metamask to store and they use our bridge to swap BitFinance, Harmony and Ethereum assets. We achieve 2-second finality for fast transactions and support 1000 delegating stakers for secure shards. 
A cross-chain Uniswap port is already live on our mainnet. Similar to layer 2 protocols.

- To make BitFinance fully interoperable with the Harmony One/Ethereum ecosystem.
